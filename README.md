<h3>
Just an application to demonstrate the possibility of creating floating nodes in the WPF environment.  
The application allows you to create, delete, edit note nodes.   

  Move, resize and save current position in database. 

Also, nodes can be fixed, which prevents accidental changes in their position and size.
